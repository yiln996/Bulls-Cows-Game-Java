Class Diagram Description

I have created 9 classes to run this game.

The PlayGame class is the entry point, handling game initialization.
It manages the game loop, user interaction, game selection (Bulls & Cows or Wordle),
and the overall game flow. It also handles result logging and saving to a file.

The Game class defines shared methods and structure for all games.
It includes the core logic to compare player guesses with secret codes.

AI is a subclass of Game, this class provides the base logic for Bulls & Cows players.
It includes methods to generate secret codes, make guesses, and track guess history.

EasyAI, MediumAI, HardAI:
Subclasses of AI that implement different difficulty levels for the Bulls & Cows game.
These can override methods providing additional logic and attributes unique to their specific game mode.

The Player class represents the human player.
Handles input such as secret codes and guesses for both Bulls & Cows and Wordle games.

Wordle is a subclass of Game.
It loads and validates a dictionary of words, ensures each word is five letters with no duplicates,
and randomly selects a target word.

InputHandler is a utility class responsible for validating and processing user input from the console.
It ensures that inputs are within expected formats or ranges, code readability and user input handling.
